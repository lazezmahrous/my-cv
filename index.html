        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         I'm a Flutter developer with nearly <strong>2 years of hands-on experience </strong> building cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and Dart. I've worked on real-world freelance projects for clients in education and e-commerce, with a strong focus on performance, clean architecture, and intuitive user interfaces.

        </p>
      
        <p>
         In addition to client work, I actively contribute to the Flutter community by producing educational content on YouTube <strong> 265+ subscribers and 7,700+ views </strong> and sharing open-source projects on GitHub. I also create short-form tech content on TikTok <strong> 4,800+ followers, 65,000+ views </strong>, helping other developers grow and learn.


        </p>
      
        <p>
          I also share short-form tech content on TikTok, where I have <strong>4,800 followers</strong>,
          over <strong>15,000 likes</strong>, and videos that have reached over <strong>65,000 views</strong>.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I'm passionate about continuous learning and believe in giving back to the community by sharing knowledge
          and building real, open-source Flutter projects for others to benefit from.

          <h3>Flutter Developer ‚Äì EasyTa3lim (Freelance, 3 weeks)</h3>
          <p>
            I was hired to refactor and enhance the structure of the EasyTa3lim mobile application. My main focus was on cleaning and organizing legacy video player code, which was previously difficult to maintain (spaghetti code).<br>
            I introduced a new, modular video player and implemented a polished splash screen with animations to improve the first-time user experience.<br>
            Additionally, I resolved a critical bug in the old video player integration that was causing playback issues on some devices.

            "At EasyTa3lim, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to our dear friend Abdelrhman Mohamed Mahrous, who went above and beyond to help us update our mobile application.

          <h3>Flutter Developer ‚Äì Era Sport (Freelance, 4 months)</h3>
          <p>
            I developed the Era Sport e-commerce app from the ground up. I designed the UI using Figma, carefully planned the features, and worked closely with the client to understand their business goals, requirements, and budget constraints.<br>
            Based on these discussions, I selected Supabase for the backend and took the time to study its documentation thoroughly before implementing authentication, storage, and data handling using it.<br>
            The final app delivered a smooth user experience and high performance, earning great feedback from both the client and users. The app is currently approaching <strong>1,000+ downloads</strong> on Google Play.

            <p>
              This Text-to-Speech app was developed from scratch after completing Omar Ahmed <strong>advanced Flutter</strong> playlist.
              I designed the entire UI myself and leveraged my Python experience to build the backend using the Flask framework.
              Throughout development, I documented every feature with dedicated commits and pull requests, sharing the journey in a series of videos on LinkedIn and Facebook.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technologies used include <strong>Flutter</strong> for the front-end with <strong>Bloc & Cubit</strong> for state management, and <strong>Python Flask</strong> for backend services.

            <p>
              Inspired by a collaboration with a math instructor, I dove deep into understanding the UCMAS method to create this fun and educational math learning app.
              The goal was to help students enjoy mathematics and build confidence through engaging content.
            </p>
            <p>
              I suggested and helped implement new features such as a storytelling section to make learning more relatable, and a level-based reward system to motivate students to solve more problems and keep using the app.

            <p>
              Built with <strong>Provider</strong> for state management, <strong>Shared Preferences</strong> for local storage, and full localization support.
